# C# Console Applications

This folder contains console-based applications demonstrating core C# programming concepts, object-oriented design principles, and fundamental programming skills.

## Projects Overview

### ThoughtTronix Order Management System
**Source:** FALL24/homework-1-ColinKorsmo  
**Technologies:** C#, Object-Oriented Programming, Collections, LINQ  
**Description:** A console application modeling a fictional AI company's product catalog and order management system. Features custom classes with relationships, list manipulation, and business logic for calculating order totals.

**Key Features:**
- Product and Order class modeling with proper encapsulation
- List-based data structures for managing collections
- Custom ToString() methods for formatted output
- Order total calculations and business logic
- Demonstrates class relationships and composition

### HelloWorld Application
**Source:** FALL24/HelloWorld  
**Technologies:** C#, .NET Core  
**Description:** Basic C# console application demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and .NET Core project structure.

### Lab Projects (Console-Based)
**Source:** FALL24/lab-1-ColinKorsmo, lab-2-ColinKorsmo  
**Technologies:** C#, Object-Oriented Programming  
**Description:** Series of laboratory exercises focusing on C# fundamentals, class design, and console application development.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Class design, encapsulation, inheritance
- **Data Structures:** Lists, collections, and data manipulation
- **Business Logic:** Calculations, data processing, and application flow
- **Code Organization:** Proper namespace usage, file structure, and commenting
- **Problem Solving:** Algorithm implementation and logical thinking

## How to Run

Each project can be run using the .NET CLI:

```bash
cd [project-folder]
dotnet run
```

## Learning Outcomes

These projects demonstrate progression from basic console output to complex object-oriented applications with multiple interacting classes and business logic implementation.
